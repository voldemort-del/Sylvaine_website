      "Architecture of Light is an exploration of what people have built, and what remains of them through time. I look at architectural and sculptural forms not as objects, but as traces of human presence that continue to exist. Through light, these structures are revealed again — gently transformed into atmosphere, memory, and perception. My work is an act of attention and respect toward what has been made and left behind, where light becomes a way of seeing what still lives within form.",
